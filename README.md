# Chaty ðŸ’¬

**Chaty** is a decentralized chat application that enables users to create chat rooms and interact with others in real-time. This lightweight, privacy-first app ensures that no chat data is stored permanently. All conversations are ephemeral and are lost when the page refreshes, making it perfect for transient, secure communication.
